Problem Statement
Mario is very hungry and wants to eat mushrooms but they are randomly hidden in a grid of
NxN where N is number of columns & rows. Mario will always start its hunt
for mushrooms from 0th cell,i.e (0,0). At the same time some grid will have poison which will kill the mario.

To help Mario move you have to use the arrow keys to
reach a particular mushroom. Mario tummy will be filled only after he has eaten all the
mushrooms in the grid. Make sure to avoid the poison grids during the hunt to keep winning.

LIST OF REQUIREMENTS:
To start the game press any arrow key.
Mario will start  to move in the direction of the arrow key pressed and will reverse its direction once it has reached the grid end points .EG - in a 10*10 grid, When mario is in 0*0 ,On press of  keyboard Right key- mario starts moving in the Right side direction until it reaches 0*10 then automatically it changes its direction to Left until it reaches 0*0 and bounces back in reverse direction again in a loop until some other direction key ( Up or Down ) is pressed.
Mario’s speed starts with a speed of 1000ms for 1 grid movement. Increase the speed of the mario’s movement for every mushroom it eats by 100ms.
At a time there can be N number of poisons placed randomly on a N*N Grid, ( Which will be hidden after 3 seconds, user should remember the position of poisons & not take those routes )
Poison should not be placed very close to the moving direction of the mario. Eg-  If mario is in 0*1 moving in the right side direction poison should not be placed at 0*2 , should at least maintain 2 grid gap. 
At a time one mushroom will appear on a non poison grid.Mario has to be moved to eat this mushroom and gain points.
Every time a mushroom is eaten, a new mushroom is placed randomly on a non poison grid and the poisons’ position is changed randomly, keeping the condition of point number 5.
Add Pause and resume button. Pause should pause the mario’s movement. 
Game should continue from the same state even on page refresh

Good to have:
      10. Use observer pattern for decoupling view and state

TECH STACK :

Please don’t use any javascript frameworks like react / angular / vue , as we wanted to evaluate your code quality based on design patterns / reusability /  Extensibility / maintainability

Evaluation criteria:

We understand the complexity of the problem & completing the problem will have a huge weightage in the entire interview process. Following are the evaluation criteria 

1. Usage of design patterns in a meaningful way [ Please add it in comment wherever you feel you wanted to explain some design philosophy that is helping solve this problem ] - 10% weightage

2. Code extensibility / Reusability / Maintainability - 20% weightage - eg 
 -  Don't use global variable
 -  Can this game be improvised to a multiplayer scenario with 2 mario chasing the same food easily ? 
 -  Is there a piece of code which can be reused tomorrow for  another feature easily without refactoring much , [ it can be as simple as having a Util fn ] , Let us know by adding a comment in the code where you feel things can be reused in future & how easy it is. 

3.  High level problem solving approach taken to solve the given problem 10% weightage

4. Separation of concerns - 10% weightage

5. Completion of requirement [ 1 - 7 ]  - 20% weightage

6. Completion of requirement [ 8  ] - 5% weightage

7. Completion of requirement [ 9  ] - 15% weightage

8. Good to have [  point - 10  ]  - 10% weightage
