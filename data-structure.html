Problem Solving / Data Structures
	
Arrays (Must)
Recursion (Must)
Optimisation (Time and space complexity)
String Manipulation
Debugging - Should be able to find problems in his code without hints.
Dynamic Programming (Good To have)
Tree problem (Good To Have, if he has answered previous questions correctly)
Stack / Queues
Trie Data structure usage
HashMap (Must)


Try not to ask direct algorithmic questions, instead real life examples making use of data structures.

Super coin referral question (BFS problem to be solved using queues)
Currying function (recursion question)
Sum of pair in numbers equal to X (Hashmap)
React reconciliation Algorithm (Finding node in Tree)
Balancing Parenthesis ( Stack question)
