Straw’s on the Board

Build a board game where `n number of straws dropped on the board randomly. Now the player has to pick the top straw. If he clicks a straw (which is on the top) then the straw will be hidden, he will earn a point, Now he has to click the next straw which is on the top until It becomes zero. Any wrong click has to intimate the player that It’s not the top one.


  



Must Haves:
Randomly generate straws on the screen with each straw in different colors.
Top straw has to be removed by clicking until the board becomes empty.
If two straws are not overlapping then we should allow them to click any straw.
A straw has to fall inside the screen.
Length of the straw should be configurable, If it’s not configured then It should be random(It can have a min-length).
Better user experience(i.e. cursor pointer on hover, animation to intimate the wrong click straw)


Good to Have:
Collect the player name before the game. Set a time limit for each level. It has to count down timer(decrement).
Increase the complexity in each level. 
Display the scoreboard.

Points to consider:
Focus on the modularity of code and design of the solution. Keep performance of the application in mind.
The solution should be coded in native / vanilla JavaScript and CSS. Please refrain from using any plugins / libraries like  jQuery / React / Angular or css frameworks like Bootstrap. However, you can use tooling such as webpack, grunt, gulp, etc.
The final solution should work without errors.
Do not completely ignore the layout / visual design. A minimalist visual design / layout must be followed, it is also important for us to evaluate your CSS knowledge.
You will be evaluated based on: 
Correctness and completeness of the solution.
Code design and quality.
Visual aesthetics (the UI should be as close as possible to the given design).
Technology choices (e.g. ES 6/7 over ES 5 - avoid mixing of ES 5/6/7).
Your understanding of the problem statement.
