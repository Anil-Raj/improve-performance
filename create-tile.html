Problem Statement
Build a UI for creating and configuring Creatives. A Creative is a container / box that contains a title and a subtitle, with a background color.

Sample UI

Font used in mocks: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito (Regular and Bold)

List of background colors: https://random-flat-colors.vercel.app/api/random?count=5
Product Features
Creative Dashboard
The dashboard loads with an empty list of Creatives. A progress bar indicates how many Creatives have been created so far. A maximum total of five Creatives are allowed. 
An “Add Creative” button can be used by the User to open the Creative Creation Drawer (details below).  When the drawer is closed, the dashboard should take 100% width.
The UI also provides a means to filter the list of Creatives via color and text. 
Users should be able to multi-select colors
List can be filtered using color and text (partial and case insensitive) simultaneously.
Creative Creation Drawer
Clicking on the “Add Creative” button changes the layout of the page by opening a drawer. The following are some styling rules when the drawer is open:
The drawer takes up 35% of the screen width and transitions in.
The “Add Creative”  button is disabled when the drawer is open.


A form needs to be made available in the drawer. A user can enter the Title and Subtitle for a Creative, and select a background color. The list of background colors needs to be fetched via the provided API. The following are some rules about the form:
All three fields are required fields. It is mandatory for the user to fill them.
The Done button on the form is disabled until all the form fields are entered by the user.


On clicking on Done, the drawer automatically closes. The Creatives Dashboard updates with the following:
The Add Creative button is enabled as the drawer is closed.
The Progress bar shows the number of Creatives created, both numerically, ie (1/5), and visually via a progress meter that transitions to show progress.
The newly created Creative is rendered as a Preview on the list. A Preview should be a rectangle whose background color is what the user selected in the form, with the title and subtitle information entered by the user  inside it.


The drawer can also be closed by clicking on a “X” (close) button or the esc key.

Must Haves:
The list of background colors must be fetched from the API.
The UI should be as close to the mocks provided.
Filtering Creatives based on color and title / subtitle text.
Points to consider:
The solution should be coded in vanilla JavaScript and CSS. Please refrain from using any plugins / libraries like  jQuery / React / Angular or css frameworks like Bootstrap. However, you can use tooling such as webpack, grunt, gulp, etc.
Focus on the modularity of code and design of the solution. Keep the performance of the application in mind.
The final solution should work without errors.
Ensure the solution’s look and feel matches the mocks as much as possible.
Focus on using the right semantic html tags. Using the right HTML tag may be faster than building your own implementation!
You will be evaluated based on: 
Correctness and completeness of the solution, and understanding of the problem statement.
Code design and quality.
Visual aesthetics and your ability to extract styling and UX information from a mock. (the UI should be as close as possible to the given design)
